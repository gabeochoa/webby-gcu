        welcome to my website!
        <p>
        allow me to introduce the site. my name is not not giselle, though i prefer to go by georgie now. this is not not a portfolio, since you may see some of how i work and may not see any of my work work. this website is not not necessarily impressive since i do not really know how to code, not that this is not homemade code. and i guess should have mentioned earlier you may or may not get a headache trying to understand this paragraph, but since you made it to the end now let me encourage you to check out the rest of the pages, they are just as fun.
